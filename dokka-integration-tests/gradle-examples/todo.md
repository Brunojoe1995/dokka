- [ ] Parameterise over Gradle version
- [ ] Parameterise over KGP version
- [ ] Parameterise over AGP version
- [ ] Parameterise Dokka version
- [ ] Parameterise K1/K2 analysis mode
- [ ] separate test dir for each test
- [ ] deduplicate repetitive test logic, e.g. extract CC report test, expected/actual HTML test
- [ ] Move tests into single source set, breaking them up isn't so useful, and makes navigation & code re-use harder.
- [ ] Create a JUnit extension that dynamically generates projects for testing.
  - Each generated project should have a distinct test directory
  - Generate exhaustive Gradle/KGP/analysis variables.
  - Dynamically `@Tag` each test according to the variables.
